Data Acquired System:
The data acquired from EEG,ECG and GSR signals by using Biosami Active 2 system.

Electrodes Palcement:

The EEG signals were captured from left and right frontal, central, anterior temporal and parietal regions
(F3, F4, C3, C4,T3, T4, P3, P4) positions according to the 10-20 system and referenced to Cz.

Files Discreption:

Two different files S01_TOH_5B.bdf and S01_TOH_4A.bdf means subject1 was played 5 disc (TOH) and after that he was palyed 4 disc (TOH).
